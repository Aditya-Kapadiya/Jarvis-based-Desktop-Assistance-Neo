# Jarvis-based-Desktop-Assistance-Neo
This repository contains the code for the jarvis based desktop assistance created by me and my group. The assistance is named as Neo.

It is not neccessary to speak "Neo" everytime while giving command. You can use it directly by giving the command.
Commits and Pull-requests are accepted. Always feel free to give suggestion and new ideas.
